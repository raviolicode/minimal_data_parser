# Data Parser for MSP

## Requirements

* CSV should be in UTF-8, and separator `;`
* Preferrably numbers should in English format, although this is not a requirement.

**Note:** if we can assure numbers will be only in a single format, we can remove the ";" separator restriction.

## Run

```
bundle
ruby minimal_data_parser.rb
```

Result is generated in `output` folder
